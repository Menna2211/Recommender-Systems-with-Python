# Recommender Systems with Python 
This project demonstrates a basic recommendation system designed to suggest items (movies) that are most similar to a given item of choice. It leverages content-based filtering to identify and rank movies based on their similarity to a selected movie. Please note that this is a simple model and not a full-fledged robust recommendation system.

# Dataset
Movies Dataset (movies.csv): Contains movie titles and their associated genres.
Ratings Dataset (ratings.csv) (Optional for advanced features): Includes user ratings of movies.

# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build a recommendation system that provides movie suggestions based on the similarity of genres. This is a content-based recommendation system using metadata from the movies.csv dataset.

# Approach
Data Processing:
Extract and preprocess the movie genres to create a feature matrix.
Similarity Computation:
Use cosine similarity to calculate the closeness between movies based on their genre vectors.
Recommendations:
Input a specific movie title, and the system returns a ranked list of movies most similar to the given title.
